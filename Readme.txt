Make your Wordpress blog more engaging with Fliptu's social media, hashtag import & collections embed tool

== Description ==

Embed your social media feeds, hash tag feeds, or personal media collections on your Wordpress blog using Fliptu's export & embed tool. First, sign in to your Fliptu account or create an account [Fliptu.com](http://www.Fliptu.com/).  

(1) Social Media Feeds - upon sign up at [Fliptu.com](http://www.Fliptu.com/),you will be prompted to connect your social media accounts. You will then be re-directed to your 'Flipstream' page (profile). Click on the 'Export Flipstream' button and customize your embed. Copy the 'iframe' code that is generated in the text box in the plugin Admin (see Installation section).

Example Social Media Feed Aggregation - [Rally America Social Page](http://fliptu.com/RallyAmerica)

(2) Hashtag Collections - after sign-up, you can create Flipbooks (collections) by visiting the 'Flipbooks' tab. Click on 'Create Flipbook', select 'Import Based on Hashtag',and enter your desired hashtag.  Fliptu then imports Twitter & Instagram media based on your hashtag (takes a few minutes).  To export, hover over your Flipbook, Click 'View Flipbook', and then click on the 'Export Flipbook' button and customize your embed. Copy the 'iframe' code that is generated in the text box in the plugin Admin.

Example hashtag collection - [#UFC157](http://fliptu.com/Fliptu/boards/132006)

(3) Manual Collections - you may also create manual collections of media, using the same Flipbook instructions above (without selecting the hashtag option). To export, hover over your Flipbook, Click 'View Flipbook', and then click on the 'Export Flipbook' button and customize your embed. Copy the 'iframe' code that is generated in the plugin Admin.
